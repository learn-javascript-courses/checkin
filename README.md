## What's a Scrum Checkin?

In agile development, we strive to implement the minimum effective amount of process to enable [high velocity development](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-build-a-high-velocity-development-team-4b2360d34021).

The scrum meeting is a common element of that minimal process. Its purpose is to allow team members to check in with each other. On each work day, each small team gathers to answer three questions:

* [ ] What did you do on the last workday?
* [ ] What are you doing today?
* [ ] Is there anything blocking you?

Scrum teams should be small, so these meetings should last less than 15 minutes.

But what about distributed teams working in different timezones? And even a 15 minute meeting is still expensive. What if you could get even better visibility without the inefficiency of a meeting?

That's where this app comes in.


## Basic Requirements

Don't worry about anything but getting the user interfaces to work. No need for user authorization, databases, or API's for now. Feel free to make some fake users and fake checkin data.

* [ ] Allow a user to create and name teams. Users own the teams they create.
* [ ] Allow a user to check in with a specific team.
* [ ] View the team status: A simple display of a running log of all the team's checkins, grouped by day.

Here's a sketch of the checkin feature.

## Screen 1: Previous Day

```

Your last checkin said you would:

* [ ] Write the README for the checkin app
* [ ] Document the stack requirements
* [ ] Complete 2 code reviews
* + Add another item

Were there any blockers? If so, please list briefly below (one line each):

* + Add a blocker from your previous checkin

Please check the items you completed, and add any additional items you completed.

[ Done ]

```

## Screen 2: Today

Carry over unfinished items from the previous day. User should be able to delete tasks.

```

What will you work on today? Try to list 3-5 things you think you can **complete** today.

* [ ] <Priority 1 Task>
* [ ] <Priority 2 Task>
* [ ] <Priority 3 Task>
* + Add another task you can probably complete today

```

## Screen 3: Blockers

Carry over any previous blockers that are not checked off.

```
Do important tasks have any blockers? If so, please list them briefly, below:

* + Add a blocker for today's tasks
```

## Screen 4:

```

1 - 5 words, what are we doing well? (optional)

[ <text input> ]


In 1 - 5 words, what needs improvement? (optional)

[ <text input> ]

üôÅ üòê üòÉ

[ Done ]

```

## Screen 5:

```

That's it. Have a great day! üéâ

```



### Mid Level Requirements

* [ ] Allow a user to join an existing team.
* [ ] Store data on a remote server and let other users sign up.
* [ ] Implement the [user stories](user-stories.md).


### Advanced Requirements

* [ ] Integrate with Slack and post reports.
* [ ] Integrate with Github. On the "What will you work on today?" feature, provide an option to link a GitHub issue from their assigned issues.
* [ ] Automate checkin updates to mark items as done when linked issues get closed on GitHub.
* [ ] Add realtime capability and update today's checkins view as checkins are added, statuses change, and checklist items get marked complete.
