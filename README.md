# CheckIn

Remote-friendly scrum without the annoying meetings.

An educational student app project originally designed for [Web Directions 2015](http://www.webdirections.org/wd15/#workshops) two pillars of JavaScript Workshop.

## Instructions

Fork this repository to your own account and implement your own CheckIn app. Feel free to recruit other people and work in groups (ideally up to 7 people).


## What's a Scrum Checkin?

In agile development, we strive to implement the minimum effective amount of process to enable [high velocity development](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-build-a-high-velocity-development-team-4b2360d34021).

The scrum meeting is a common element of that minimal process. Its purpose is to allow team members to check in with each other. On each work day, each small team gathers to answer three questions:

* What did you do on the last workday?
* What are you doing today?
* Is there anything blocking you?

Scrum teams should be small, so these meetings should last less than 15 minutes.

But what about distributed teams working in different timezones? And even a 15 minute meeting is still expensive. What if you could get even better visibility without the inefficiency of a meeting?

That's where this app comes in.


## App Requirements

* Allow a user to create a profile and log in. Keep this as simple as possible. Keep it simple. Consider an out-of-the-box solution such as [FireBase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/user-auth.html).
* Allow a user to create and name teams. Users own the teams they create.
* Allow team owners to add people to the team.
* Allow a user to check in with a specific team and answer each of the three scrum questions.
* Allow team members to view the team status: A simple display of each user's most recent checkin.

That's it.

Here's a simple mock-up of the checkin feature:
